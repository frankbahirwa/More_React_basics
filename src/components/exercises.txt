Create a DynamicForm component that accepts a fields prop (an array of objects).
 Each object contains the field type (text, email, number, etc.),
  placeholder, and name. The form should render inputs dynamically
   based on the fields array.

The component should also accept
 a onSubmit prop that receives the form 
 data as an object when the form is submitted.
